My name is Gohar Zehra and I am currently a student studying in Ned University.
I am majoring in bachelors of Computer Science which is unfortunately completely different from my interests and hobbies but not entirely boring.
When I was a kid, I saw myself as an astronaut, as a doctor and what not? but I never once imagined that one day I would choose to sit in front of the computer for hours straight. 
As an 18 year old who wants to step out of her comfort zone, I really hope I can enjoy my stay in Ned although with endless assignments and piling deadlines, its proving to be a tad bit difficult.
